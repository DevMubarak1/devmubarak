macOS-inspired Liquid-Glass Portfolio: Design Guide
Dev Mubarak’s portfolio aims to mimic a macOS desktop with frosted-glass “liquid” windows for each section. Many examples and OSS projects already pursue this aesthetic. For instance, the OSFOLIO project (React, TypeScript, Tailwind) simulates a full desktop UI with draggable, resizable windows and a taskbar
github.com
. Likewise, another macOS-themed portfolio (built in SvelteKit) advertises “A desktop-like interface with Status Bar, Widgets and Dock…Draggable and resizable windows” plus minimize/maximize controls
github.com
. A Next.js/React portfolio on Peerlist recreates the macOS experience with a glassmorphic UI, interactive Dock, dynamic menu bar, and draggable app windows
peerlist.io
. In practice, these designs place each content section (About, Projects, Contact, etc.) in its own “app window” with macOS-style title bar (red/yellow/green buttons) and a translucent backdrop. Key takeaways:
Desktop Metaphor: Use a pseudo-desktop layout with icons or a Launchpad and a Dock; each portfolio section opens in its own window.
github.com
peerlist.io
Window Styling: Emulate macOS controls and glass panels. For example, OSFOLIO features “Draggable, resizable, and minimizable windows with macOS-inspired controls”
github.com
.
Dark/Light Mode: Include both themes. Most UI projects (OSFOLIO, Dhruv’s portfolio) provide dark & light glass styles.
Smooth Animations: Transitions on opening/closing windows, icon hover, and a subtle stage-manager animation can enhance realism.
By studying these examples (OSFOLIO, the SvelteKit portfolio, Peerlist showcase, etc.), you’ll see how each section can be treated as a separate “app window” on a glassy desktop. They also commonly include a menu bar, dock, and even widgets (clock, music player) to sell the OS illusion

Liquid Glass Visual Effects
The hallmark is a frosted glass panel effect: translucent, blurred windows that softly distort the desktop background. This “glassmorphism” trend is characterized by transparency, blur, subtle borders, and a lifted appearance
franwbu.com
. To implement it:
CSS Backdrop-Filter: The simplest approach uses backdrop-filter: blur(...) on a semi-transparent element (with background: rgba(...))
developer.mozilla.org
. This applies a blur to everything behind the element, replicating the frosted look. (MDN notes that modern browsers support backdrop-filter as of late 2024
developer.mozilla.org
.) For example, one code snippet uses:
css
Copy
Edit
.liquidGlass-effect {
  backdrop-filter: blur(3px);
  /* vendor-prefix if needed: -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(3px); */
  /* an SVG filter for extra distortion */
  filter: url(#glass-distortion);
}
.liquidGlass-tint {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25);
}
.liquidGlass-shine {
  /* subtle inner highlight */
  box-shadow: inset 2px 2px 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.5), inset -1px -1px 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
}
This example (from CodePen) layers a blurred backdrop, a white-tint overlay, and a “shine” overlay with subtle box-shadows
codepen.io
. In practice you’d place your window content (text/images) above these layers.
SVG Noise/Distortion: Pure blur can look static. Adding an SVG noise texture overlay introduces organic variation (tiny light flecks, subtle warp) for realism. As described by Er. Raj Aryan, combining backdrop-filter with an SVG noise filter yields a “lightweight, responsive, and visually stunning” living glass effect
medium.com
. In other words, an SVG filter (e.g. with Perlin noise + displacement) can simulate the slight distortion of real glass.
Tint and Lighting: Typical macOS glass panels have a tinted white/grey overlay (see code above) and inner glows. Use a semi-transparent white (or softly colored) RGBA layer for the tint, plus semi-transparent white inset shadows for highlights and outer shadows for depth.
Performance: Real-time blur is GPU-intensive. Current browsers support it but may struggle if overused. One guide warns that if backdrop-filter isn’t fully optimized, it “can be even worse… especially for performance”
dev.to
. To mitigate this:
Only blur what’s necessary (limit window size or frequency).
Consider using transform: translate3d(...) or will-change: transform hacks to create a new GPU layer, which can help performance
stackoverflow.com
.
Provide a fallback (e.g. a static semi-blurred PNG background) for very old browsers as suggested by some answers
stackoverflow.com
.
On mobile, you may disable or reduce blur (mobile GPUs are weaker).
Alternative Approaches: If CSS blur proves too slow or unsupported, a WebGL shader (e.g. via Three.js or GLSL) can generate a faux-glass refraction more efficiently on the GPU. However, many designers find CSS + SVG noise easier and “no JavaScript or WebGL needed” to achieve a living glass effect
medium.com
.
In summary, liquid glass = backdrop-filter: blur() + tinted overlay + highlights. For example, one implementation uses an SVG filter (url(#glass-distortion)) on a blurred backdrop plus a 25% white tint
codepen.io
. This matches the glassmorphism guidelines: “transparency, blur, subtle borders, and a floating appearance”
franwbu.com
. Keep layers sparse and GPU-accelerated for best performance.
Window Dragging/Resizing Libraries
To make each “window” movable and resizable, you can use existing libraries:
React RND (react-rnd): A popular MIT-licensed component that makes any React element draggable and resizable. It’s highly starred (4.2k⭐) and supports bounds, aspect-ratio, grid snapping, etc. Usage is straightforward: e.g. <Rnd default={{ x:0, y:0, width:320, height:200 }} …>…</Rnd>. This covers most needs with minimal setup
github.com
.
React-Flexi-Window: A newer, lightweight React component specifically for draggable/resizable windows
dev.to
. It’s only ~90KB (no extra deps) and includes touch-friendly corner handles, viewport bounds, and built-in styling (colors, blur, shadows). For instance, it supports setting width/height/position props and even includes animated resize handles
dev.to
. This could be a great ready-made solution.
Windrag (Axorax): A tiny (~2.5KB) vanilla JS library for draggable windows
npmjs.com
. You simply call windrag.create('.selector', '.handle') to make an element movable. It even supports methods to hide or maximize a window programmatically
npmjs.com
npmjs.com
. Its minimalist design makes it easy to drop into any project without heavy dependencies.
Window Engine: Another lightweight, no-dependency JS lib for draggable windows
github.com
. It provides a CSS/JS combo with predefined window HTML structure and colors, and supports touch screens. Its GitHub (“Window Engine”) describes it as “a lightweight and touchscreen friendly zero-dependency JavaScript library for draggable windows.”
github.com
. It may require using their HTML template, but it’s convenient.
Interact.js: For highly custom behavior, consider Interact.js. It offers drag/resize/gestures for any element and works with or without frameworks. You can configure resizable edges and drag handles via code (see [46]). This is overkill for simple use, but powerful if you need freeform constraints or inertia.
Other Options: Simple combinations like react-draggable + re-resizable (two separate libs) also work. “Golden Layout” or “PhosphorJS” are full-featured window-managers used in complex web apps (e.g. trading dashboards). Framer Motion (in React) can also do dragging with drag props, though manual resizing would need extra code. Depending on your stack, choose a library that best balances features vs. weight.
Key considerations: Ensure the library supports both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) input. Many drag libraries listen to touch events automatically, but you may also want to disable dragging entirely on very small screens and revert to a simplified layout (see next section). Test responsiveness thoroughly.
Recommended Tech Stack
To build a polished macOS-style portfolio, use modern web frameworks and tools:
Framework: React is a natural fit (most example projects use it). OSFOLIO, for instance, is built with React 18 and TypeScript
github.com
. A Next.js or Vite setup can handle bundling and static hosting. Alternatively, SvelteKit (as used by ansxuman’s portfolio) or Vue/Nuxt would work if you prefer them. The Peerlist example uses Next.js+TypeScript
peerlist.io
. The key is a component-based SPA (or statically generated SPA) that you can host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.
Styling: Tailwind CSS is highly recommended. All the above examples use Tailwind for rapid styling (OSFOLIO and Dhruv’s portfolio explicitly list Tailwind)
github.com
peerlist.io
. Tailwind’s backdrop-blur and utility classes make it easy to apply frosted-glass effects and spacing. Alternatively, CSS-in-JS (styled-components/emotion) or a utility library like Radix or Headless UI (or the shadcn/ui components used in OSFOLIO
github.com
) can help with theme toggling and accessibility.
Animations: Use an animation library for smooth UI. Framer Motion (used in OSFOLIO) offers spring/tween animations for React components
github.com
. You could also use GSAP or anime.js if you prefer. These are useful for window open/close, icon bounce, cursor-based parallax, etc. For example, Framer Motion’s <motion.div drag> can add inertia to dragging.
Interactivity: For the cursor-responsive “liquid” tilt/parallax on the glass, consider a small library like Vanilla-Tilt.js or implement mousemove listeners. Libraries like Vanilla-Tilt apply 3D tilt on hover. However, use sparingly for performance.
TypeScript: Strongly consider TS for type safety (as used in OSFOLIO and Peerlist examples
github.com
peerlist.io
). It helps manage state (window positions, z-index stacking) without bugs.
Build Tools: A fast bundler like Vite (used by OSFOLIO
github.com
) or Next.js (for routing/SSR) is ideal. Both work well with GitHub/Netlify. Vite gives near-instant rebuilds for development, while Next can also generate static pages (helpful if you add a blog section).
UI Components: You might not need a full component library, but Radix UI (headless accessible primitives) plus a theme (shadcn/ui) was used by OSFOLIO
github.com
 for menus and dialogs. TailwindUI or ChakraUI could also speed development. At minimum, implement macOS-style window chrome (close/minimize buttons) and system fonts.
Accessibility: Ensure text on glass panels remains legible (good contrast/shadows), and provide alt text for icons. Glassmorphism can reduce readability, so use text-shadow or slightly darker backgrounds if needed
dev.to
.
In summary: a modern React+TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion stack is a safe choice (as exemplified by OSFOLIO
github.com
). SvelteKit or Next.js+TS are also excellent, especially since there’s an open Svelte portfolio and a Next.js example. Use Git, CI (linting/testing), and host on GitHub/Vercel for an open-source-ready project.
Single-Page Integration & Mobile Responsiveness
Finally, integrate the above into a cohesive single-page scroll:
Layout: You can treat each section (About, Projects, Blog, Contact) as a floating window on one “desktop” canvas. As the user scrolls, windows might fade in or reposition. Alternatively, start with a static desktop (with icons or dock) and open windows on click. Either way, use CSS scroll snapping or anchor links to navigate between sections without full page reloads.
Window Sections: Each “window” can contain the section’s content (HTML/React components). Ensure each window is independently scrollable if its content is long (e.g. a scrolling blog window). For example, OSFOLIO’s “Contact” or “Projects” app is a scrollable pane inside a window.
Responsive Design: On small screens, traditional free-floating windows don’t work well. All examples switch layouts on mobile. OSFOLIO, for instance, abandons the desktop and shows a touch-friendly app grid with bottom navigation
github.com
. Similarly, you should detect narrow viewports and maybe stack sections vertically or use a tab-based interface. Disable dragging on mobile if necessary, or constrain windows full-width. Always test on a phone viewport. Key practices:
Use CSS media queries or a React “useIsMobile” hook to switch to mobile mode.
Provide a simplified UI: e.g. a top/bottom menu bar linking to each “app”.
Touch interactions: ensure buttons/handles are large enough; add enough padding; consider swipe gestures for windows.
Open Source Readiness: Structure your code and repo like the examples. Include a clear README (with usage instructions and screenshots). OSFOLIO’s repo shows a good structure with /src/components/OperatingSystem/Window.tsx, etc.. Write your code modularly (one component per window/app), and use descriptive CSS classes or Tailwind utility layers. Use a permissive license (e.g. MIT) so others can reuse your code. CI tools (ESLint, Prettier) and a live demo link (OSFOLIO links to amaansyed.vercel.app) help adoption.
By combining these elements – Mac-inspired UI patterns, efficient glass effects, draggable-window libraries, and a modern JS stack – you can create a portfolio that truly feels like a sleek macOS desktop. Each section-as-window will have its own blurred glass panel, responsive movements, and polished animations, all fitting together in a single-page site that works on both desktop and mobile
